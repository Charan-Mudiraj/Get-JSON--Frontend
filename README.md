## How I got the idea ?

I was building [AMAZON CLONE](https://amazon-clone-by-charan.vercel.app/). I had no source to collect JSON data for categories, product details, etc. Collecting(copying) the data from [AMAZON](https://amazon.in), and writing it in JSON format for every product was a tedious task of the project.

## What is this Application ?

"Get JSON" is a simple web-scraping tool which provides JSON data from web-pages, required for your project. Thereby saving tons of copy-pasting time.

## How does it work ? (Steps)

**Step-1:** The URLs from which the similar(same props) data to be fetched are specified in URLs Section.

**Step-2:** The Classes(whole string) of required data's HTML element are specified in classes section, with other optional settings.

- **Key-name** : Unique name given to a value in an object.
- **Data-type [String, Number, Boolean]** : Data-type of a value.
- **Search-type [Single Value, Multiple Values]**: Search Until a value is found (or) Search whole page and find all values.
- **Value-Type [inner text, href, src, custom]**: Type of value to be extracted from selected HTML element (Attribute/Inner-Text).

(And ofcourse the same keys can be fetched for multiple URLs)
